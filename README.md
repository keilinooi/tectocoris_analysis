# README

Code for all analyses (reflectivity, heating, and statistical) can be found in "tectocoris_analysis.Rmd" located in the "scripts" folder.

NOTE: In order for all code to run, please unzip the two zip files (heating_data.zip and bug_pics.zip) located in the "data" folder.

Items in "data" folder:
1. **specs.xlsx** - raw data from spectrophometer readings.
2. **tectocoris_data.xlsx** - data about the bug ID, sex, body size, and proportion of iridescence/non-iridescence (taken from image data, which is not included but is available on request).
3. **heating_data.zip** - when unzipped, this folder contains the temperature readings from heating experiments. It includes 129 .csv files named in the format: treatment_bugID; eg. full_01male. Column C contain the bug temperature readings, while column D contains the air temperature readings.
4. **bug_pics.zip** - when unzipped, contains cropped images of the bugs used for plotting in figures.

Please contact me if you have any questions or issues.
